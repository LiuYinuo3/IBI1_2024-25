# Summary of Findings and Interpretation

# 1. Length and Subcellular Localisation of the Human SOD2 Protein
The human SOD2 protein has a length of 222 amino acids. 
Its subcellular localisation is mitochondrial.

# 2. Range of Percentage Identities in Reported Online BLAST Results
After performing the online BLAST search, 
the range of percentage identities in the results was found to be from 58.1% to 100%. 


# 3. Alignment Scores and Percentage of Identical Amino Acids for Python - Performed Comparisons
- **Human vs Mouse**: The alignment score was 1097.0 and the percentage of identical amino acids was 90.09%. This score and percentage suggest a certain level of similarity between the human and mouse SOD2 proteins. 
- **Human vs Random**: The alignment score was -260.0 and the percentage of identical amino acids was 4.05%. 
- **Mouse vs Random**: The alignment score was -271.0 and the percentage of identical amino acids was 3.60%. 

Based on the alignment scores and percentage of identical amino acids, the human and mouse SOD2 sequences are most closely related. 
The higher alignment score and percentage identity between these two sequences compared to their comparisons with the random sequence indicate that they share a more recent common ancestor and likely have conserved functional and structural features.
